    instead (Closes: #746507).

ben (0.6.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add --more-binary-keys and --more-binary-keys CLI options to be
    able to specify further relevant binary or source keys to consider
    when running `ben monitor`.
    This is a way to extend the default list of keys considered by Ben
    and which was introduced in 6f532423296083bed50b85a6ffb29b53e1349e23.
  * Remove ia64 from default list of architectures (Closes: #743724).
  * Translate to lowercase user-specified field names
  * Capitalize field names (and take into account a word separator) when
    printing them.
  * Add --preferred-compression-format (or -z) command line option to
    specify which compression algorithm to use. Known formats are Gzip,
    Bz2 and Xz. This automatically makes them known to "ben download"
    and "ben query".
  * Update architectures lists:
    - Remove sparc from Debian architectures.
    - Add HPPA in Debian Ports list.
  * Now cache-dir, cache-file and use-cache can be set in configuration
    files.
  * Read $HOME/.benrc file at startup and provide --no-benrc to skip it
    (Closes: #746046).

ben (0.6.5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stéphane Glondu ]
  * Upload to unstable

      existing .ben files using it might need update
  * Add visual indication for sources that build "MA: same" binaries
    (Closes: #711908)
  * New computation of dependency levels, which should give better results
    when there are cycles or several connected components
  * Drop dependency to ocamlgraph (no longer used)
  * Update Vcs-*
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4 (no changes)

  [ Mehdi Dogguy ]
  * Fix changelog urls
  * Only warn instead of exiting when a .ben file is incorrect
  * Better error reporting wrt. configuration files
  * Separator between comparison operators and versions can be empty
  * Handle architecture restrictions in packages' relationships
  * Command-line flags --use-cache and --cache-file are now available
    for all frontends.

  [ Johannes Schauer ]
  * Allow creation of a cache in download (Closes: #714703)

    Benl_error and Benl_templates.
  * Provide minimal documentation about HTML templates for Ben, and how
    to build them.

ben (0.6.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix a typo in Makefile which made the build system try a native
    build on architectures where dynlink.cmxa is not available.

 -- Mehdi Dogguy <mehdi@debian.org>  Mon, 08 Oct 2012 21:47:47 +0200

ben (0.6.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Make libjs-jquery a strong dependency and put a symlink in media
    (Closes: #680273)
  * Add docbook-xsl to Build-Depends (needed on Ubuntu to build the
    documentation). Thanks to Iain Lane!
  * Add a basic template mechanism
    - HTML templates are put under /usr/lib/ben/templates
    - Add --template command line option to "ben monitor" and "ben tracker"
    - Add "template" and "base-url" as configuration keys for "ben tracker"
  * The "media" directory is taken care by Ben directly now when "monitor"
    and "tracker" are used (See commit a5c222db6990da84ec30e4878d53bbda6).
  * Fix dependencies of the library in the META file.
