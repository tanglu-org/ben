ben (0.6.2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add missing dependency on curl. Thanks to Luca Falavigna for spotting
    it!
  * Make libjs-jquery a strong dependency and put a symlink in media
    (Closes: #680273)
  * Add docbook-xsl to Build-Depends (needed on Ubuntu to build the
    documentation). Thanks to Iain Lane!
  * Add a basic template mechanism
    - HTML templates are put under /usr/lib/ben/templates
    - Add --template command line option to "ben monitor" and "ben tracker"
    - Add "template" and "base-url" as configuration keys for "ben tracker"
  * The "media" directory is taken care by Ben directly now when "monitor"
    and "tracker" are used (See commit a5c222db6990da84ec30e4878d53bbda6).
  * Fix dependencies of the library in the META file.
