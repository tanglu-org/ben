Description: toolbox for Debian maintainers
 This is a collection of useful tools that Debian maintainers can use
 to make their packaging work easier. They all work with regular
 Debian package list files, and should be useful for Debian
 derivatives as well. This package ships a single executable, "ben",
 with the following subcommands:
  * download: download a set of package list files from a mirror
  * monitor: monitor the status of a set of packages across several
    architectures (useful for transitions)
  * query: query packages using their metadata (similar to grep-dctrl,
    but uses a dedicated query language)
  * tracker: frontend to multiple monitors
